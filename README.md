## What does Foodle do?
Foodle is a platform to discuss, share and present food places. Users can post about places created by owners, like restaurants and bars, discuss and score them. It also provides a subscription system to connect users with the posters they like.

## What is this?
This is the repository which holds the bundle of our web application. Yes, it is open-sourced.

## What is your stack?
We even don't know our stack, nevertheless it seemed to me like micro-services oriented non-**opinionated**, since Flask is a Sinatra-like microframework. However, we shall not bible out our rules, we are going MVC anyways.
